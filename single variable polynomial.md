This is the version of [[polynomial]] that we are talking about for [[grade 11 math]]

This is a [[polynomial]] with only 1 [[variable]]

In other words:

In mathematics, a single variable polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of one variable and [[coefficients]], that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction of terms, multiplication of coefficients and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers of the , and has a finite number of terms.


Example $p(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 50x^{25} + 3026x^{20000}$

fun facts:
$p(1)$ is the sum of the coefficients
$p(0)$ is the constant
$p(-1)$ is (the sum of the coefficients of terms with even exponent) minus (the sum of the coefficients of terms with an odd exponent)


A polynomial has roots
